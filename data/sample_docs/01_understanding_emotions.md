# Understanding Emotions

Emotions are complex psychological states that involve three distinct components: a subjective experience, a physiological response, and a behavioral or expressive response.

## Types of Emotions

### Primary Emotions
Primary emotions are those that are considered universal across cultures:
- Joy
- Sadness
- Fear
- Anger
- Surprise
- Disgust

### Secondary Emotions
Secondary emotions are learned and develop from primary emotions:
- Guilt (combination of fear and sadness)
- Shame (combination of fear and disgust)
- Pride (combination of joy and surprise)

## Emotional Regulation

Emotional regulation refers to the processes by which individuals influence which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and express these emotions.

### Healthy Regulation Strategies
1. **Cognitive reappraisal**: Changing how you think about a situation
2. **Mindfulness**: Observing emotions without judgment
3. **Social support**: Sharing feelings with trusted others
4. **Physical activity**: Using movement to process emotions

### Unhealthy Regulation Strategies
- Suppression: Hiding emotions from others
- Rumination: Repeatedly thinking about negative events
- Avoidance: Refusing to acknowledge emotions

## The Window of Tolerance

The window of tolerance is a concept that describes the optimal zone of arousal where a person can function most effectively. When within this window, emotions can be processed without becoming overwhelming.

- **Hyperarousal**: Above the window - anxiety, panic, hypervigilance
- **Hypoarousal**: Below the window - numbness, disconnection, depression
