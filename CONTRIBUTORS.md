### Theoretical Foundations

This project builds upon the work of many researchers and practitioners:

- **Karl Friston** - Free Energy Principle and Active Inference
- **Claude Shannon** - Information Theory foundations
- **Judith Herman** - Trauma and Recovery framework
- **Bessel van der Kolk** - Body-based trauma understanding
- **Marsha Linehan** - Dialectical Behavior Therapy principles
- **International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD)** - DID treatment guidelines

### Open Source Dependencies

ReUnity is built with the following open source technologies:

- Python and the Python Software Foundation
- NumPy and SciPy for numerical computing
- FastAPI for the web framework
- Cryptography library for security
- pytest for testing

### Special Thanks

- To all survivors who have shared their experiences and needs
- To mental health professionals who provided clinical guidance
- To the open source community for their invaluable tools
- To early testers who helped refine the system
